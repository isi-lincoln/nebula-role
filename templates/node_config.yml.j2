# remote_allow_list allows you to control ip ranges that this node will
# consider when handshaking to another node. By default, any remote IPs are
# allowed. You can provide CIDRs here with `true` to allow and `false` to
# deny. The most specific CIDR rule applies to each remote. If all rules are
# "allow", the default will be "deny", and vice-versa. If both "allow" and
# "deny" IPv4 rules are present, then you MUST set a rule for "0.0.0.0/0" as
# the default. Similarly if both "allow" and "deny" IPv6 rules are present,
# then you MUST set a rule for "::/0" as the default.

# local_allow_list allows you to filter which local IP addresses we advertise

# additionally, you can specify an `interfaces` map of regular expressions

# All interface rules must be either true or false (and the default will be
# the inverse). CIDR rules are matched after interface name rules.
# Default is all local IP addresses.
